# Step 1
If you do not have an account at empatica, you can create one [here](http://get.empatica.com/win/EmpaticaBLEServer.html).
After it has been created, click on *become a developer* on the top right of the site. Here you need to input a `purchase key`, 
so that your account can interact with the device. On this page you will also find the `API key`, which we will use later. 

# Step 2
Download and install the bluetooth drivers found [here](https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/software/BLED112-Signed-Win-Drv.zip).

# Step 3
Download and install the [E4 streaming server](http://get.empatica.com/win/EmpaticaBLEServer.html).

From the tonic and phasic components of each childâ€™s EDA
signal, we extracted the following IF features: mean,
standard deviation, area under the curve, relative positions
of maximum and minimum values, slope (estimated by
linear interpolation), average number of peaks, and average
of the peaks amplitudes.

slope is linear interpolation of
    1) min point
    2) (max point - min point) / 2
